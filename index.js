  /*
  The DOMContentLoaded event is now a widely accepted standard. Modern web development, however, provides us with additional choices for setting up when we want our JavaScript to execute. For example, HTML5 now has a defer attribute for use in <script> tags:
  <script src="index.js" defer></script>
